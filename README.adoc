= Python Generic TypedDict

== My notes while drafting a https://www.python.org/dev/peps/[PEP]

The PR that started my journey through this rabbit hole: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/pull/1390

Advice in typing-sig mailing list with a sketch on how to move forward with a PEP: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/thread/GKKSWMONVHRLFI4NJAT36RPZCGGIBJ3G/

== Goal

To extend `https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/[typing.TypedDict]` with generic value support.
At the moment `TypedDict` is a special type that is not paramterizable. We need to add runtime support for it through `stdlib` and provide a type consistency specification for type checkers.

from typing import TypedDict, TypeVar, Generic, List
T = TypeVar("T")

class TD(Generic[T], TypedDict):
    f1: List[T]
    
def test_td(aa: TD[T], bb: TD[T]):
    return aa["f1"], bb["f1"]

td1 = test_td({"f1": ["foo"]}, {"f1": ["bar"]})
reveal_type(td1) # info: Type of "td1" is "tuple[List[str], List[str]]"

== TODO

As sketched out by David Foster in typing-sig.

* [ ] Draft a PEP
* [ ] Get reviewed in typing-sig, get soft approval
* [ ] Implementations:
** [ ] Generic `TypedDict` runtime in `typing_extensions`
** [ ] Generic `TypedDict` in one of the type checkers
* [ ] Get the PEP approved
